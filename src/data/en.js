  Punkt2Head: "EXECUTION",
  Punkt2: "The art project is discussed in great detail to ensure conformity with the customer's vision or specific sources of inspiration. If the customer does not have a specific vision, the artist can create an individual painting design tailored to a specific interior. Customers are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the artist's portfolio to understand the aesthetics and work style. The customer is offered one free correction, not exceeding 20% of the entire artwork's surface. Corrections requiring changes to a greater number of elements will be additionally charged. The waiting time for the service depends on the size of the painting, the technique, and the time it takes to complete the project. It is determined individually and depends on the number of orders in a given month. The approximate completion time is 1-3 months.",
